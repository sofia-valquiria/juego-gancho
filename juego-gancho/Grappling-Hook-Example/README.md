# Grappling-Hook-Example
How to grapple hook (in Godot 3.3) using Hooke's law. If you make something
with this, it'd be nice to let me know or credit me! (Calvin Wong)

The equation:
F<sub>s</sub> = k<sub>s</sub> * (distance(p<sub>a</sub>, p<sub>b</sub>) - L)

This gives the force F<sub>s</sub> as a scalar (a single number), not a vector,
where distance(p<sub>a</sub>, p<sub>b</sub>) is the distance between the two ends
of the rope/spring, L is the rest length of the rope/spring, and k<sub>s</sub> is
just a customizable constant for how stiff the rope/spring is.

I also included some nice lighting, and messed with the default toon shader.
